# Creating a module - How to

## File Structure

	Inside the res://modules folder, create a folder with a unique name for your mod.
The unique name can't contain any dot (.). This is because rhysta takes the mod name from
the pck or zip file. Prefer pck over zip files.

Example of allowed names:
	- osu_standard.pck
	- taiko_no_tatsujin.zip
	- sound_voltex.pck

Example of not allowed name:
	- etterna_v0.41.pck
